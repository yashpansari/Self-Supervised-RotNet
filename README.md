# Self-Supervised-RotNet

Used self-supervised learning in tandem with various modern ResNet models; Trained them on common image databases such as CIFAR-10,
MNIST, etc. using PyTorch and git; Built a RotNet model to extract features from diverse types of unlabelled images (without human supervision).
